# Various_Tree_Traversal


During Learning how to iterate through all the objects in a tree in a predictable and efficient manner, I tried to implement these four types of traversal.

Breadth_First_Search:
The breadth-first traversal visits all nodes at depth k before proceeding onto depth k + 1
I implemented it using queue. 
Run time is Q(n)
Memory is potentially expensive:  maximum nodes at a given depth


Depth first traversals:
visit always go as deep as possible before visiting other siblings
it includes Pre-order in-order and post-order.
